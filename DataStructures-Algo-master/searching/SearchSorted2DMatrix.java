	  > Every row is sorted left to right in increasing order. The first integer of

	/*
	  Here is a very pure 2D matrix to exemplify our mapping system. each cell has its conceptual
	  index if we flattened the 2D matrix into a 1D sorted array.
	  [ 0, 1, 2 ]
	  [ 3, 4, 5 ]
	  [ 6, 7, 8 ]
	  totalRows = 3
	  totalColumns = 3
	  Coordinate Mappings -> (row, col)
	  [ (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2) ]
	  [ (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2) ]
	  [ (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2) ]
	  Given a 1D index position .. we declare our mapping equations:
	  row in 2D matrix: 1DIndex / totalColumns
	  col in 2D matrix: 1DIndex % totalColumns
	  Example:
	  We want to find the coordinate for element 6.
	  row in 2D matrix: (6) / 3 = 2
	  col in 2D matrix: (6) % 3 = 0
	  
	  Output: (2, 0)
	  We are correct.
